add a monitor thread that should stop treads exection when a philo die : it does that by setting
a shared variable to true , this variabler should be checked before each philo acttion


each philo action should check for this variblae

if a a philo died while sleeping how will the monitor respond



sometimes after a philosopher dies the process hangs

philos dies at the exact 800ms intreval : ft_usleep or 
change place when assign first time being alive
