add a monitor thread that should stop treads exection when a philo die : it does that by setting
a shared variable to true , this variabler should be checked before each philo acttion


each philo action should check for this variblae

if a a philo died while sleeping how will the monitor respond



sometimes after a philosopher dies the process hangs

philos dies at the exact 800ms intreval : ft_usleep or 
change place when assign first time being alive.


5 800 200 200 philo sometimes dies : it happens when they eat the start ..  : ---> a little delay before they start eating since they have alive time

 eating at the start :::---> take fork think eat

 subject : eat-->sleep they think when they are awake :: so it is possbile to take fork think. then eat then sleep
    change routine.

!! sometimes messages get printed after the philo is done eating
    

implement enum instead of defines

merge take fork and eat
merge sleep and think;


if 2 and 3 eat the start --> error
if 2 and 4 eat works
